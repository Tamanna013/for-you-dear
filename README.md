## Overview

"For You, Dear" is a fun, interactive project showcasing draggable paper cards that reveal heartfelt messages and images. It's designed to offer a personalized and interactive experience for someone special. This project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a smooth, visually appealing interface.

## Features
-- Draggable Notes: Users can drag and rearrange the notes freely.
-- Custom Fonts: Unique fonts for a handwritten, personalized look.
-- Hover Effects: Subtle hover animations for a polished touch.
-- Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices.
-- Interactive Messages: Each note contains meaningful text and paired images to convey emotions.

## File Structure
Root Directory:
-- index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
-- styles.css: The CSS file responsible for styling the webpage, including fonts, colors, and layout.
-- script.js: The JavaScript file adding interactivity, such as drag-and-drop functionality and animations.
-- Rest are just images used in the project.

## Detailed Explanation of Files

### 1. index.html
This is the primary file that defines the structure of the webpage. Key elements include:
<u>Head Section:</u>
Imports Google Fonts (Caveat, Oswald, and Playfair Display). Links the styles.css file for styling. Includes a title, "For you dear ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ»".
<u>Body Section:<u>
Contains multiple <div class="paper image"> elements, each representing a draggable paper card. Each card has a <p> tag for the text message. An <img> tag to display an associated image.

### 2. styles.css
This file defines the visual appearance of the website. Key sections include:
A. General Styling:<br>
body styled with a black background and a centered layout. Background images and hover effects are implemented for a polished look.
B. Paper Cards:<br>
.paper class styles each note with a shadow, padding, and rotation for an organic, handwritten feel. .paper:hover enhances the shadow for an interactive hover effect.
C. Fonts and Colors:<br>
Custom fonts (Caveat for a handwritten look, Playfair Display for elegance). Text colors and shadows for a vivid and readable design.

3. script.js
This file handles the functionality of draggable notes. It:
-- Implements mouse and touch event listeners.<br>
-- Tracks drag-and-drop movement for each paper card.<br>
-- Updates the z-index dynamically to ensure the dragged note appears on top.

Key logic includes:
-- handleMove: Calculates the position and rotation of each card during a drag.<br>
-- init: Adds event listeners to make each card draggable and rotatable.

###How It Works: The webpage loads with several draggable cards. Each card has a unique message and image. Users can click and drag cards around the screen, rearranging them as desired. Subtle hover effects enhance the user experience.
